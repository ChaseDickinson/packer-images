# Packer Ubuntu Builds

## This repo is a work in progress

## TODO:

- Virtualbox Guest Additions install for base box
- Convert scripts to Ansible Playbooks
- Validate/cleanup preseed files
- Configure [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#intro) and use something like [this](https://github.com/cisagov/pre-commit-packer)
- Publish box to Vagrant Cloud
- Create Docker image
- Publish Docker image to Docker Hub
- Add additional OS templates (Pop!_OS, Ubuntu server)

## Credit

Took a lot of inspiration from [Chef's Bento project](https://github.com/chef/bento) and the [Boxcutter](https://github.com/boxcutter) project, especially for Virtualbox & Vagrant configurations and the minimize/cleanup scripts.
